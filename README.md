# Exercise Description
> For your exercise 1 you need to create an app named your profile app. At the start of the app, you need to select your hobbies. You are required to list at least 10 of your hobbies. Then when I click the navigation button (upper right button/icon). It will be redirected to a page. The page contacts My Profile as the header. Then it shows your name, student number, and a minimum 5 sentence description of yourself. Then all the hobbies you selected on the 1st page. The theme of your app should show your favorite colors.
